description: Eight-axis judgment code review for the current diff — Correctness, Simplification, Tests, Documentation, Style, Intent, Design/API, Performance (+ Coherence on metadata changes). Five-phase pipeline scope → deterministic tool battery (npx/uvx-preferred, zero-install for the JS + Python majority) → 8 parallel LLM axis reviewers → Haiku validators on sub-80 findings (verbatim rubric, ≥80 threshold) → synthesis with no-silent-drop + Conventional Comments JSONL. Every report closes with "What I did NOT check" (security → /security-review, runtime perf, flaky detection). Opt-in flags `--verify-build`, `--mutation-test`, `--reconcile`, `--apply-safe`. Public-skill posture — zero auto-install, graceful skip on missing native tools. Invoke before a commit or PR — "review my changes", "deep review", "did I miss anything", "check before I commit", "audit this PR", "drift / gaps / blind spots".
when_to_use: 'User-invoked before commit or PR; runs the full 8-axis fan-out — no tiers. Defers security to /security-review (link in every report); defers runtime performance and benchmarks (explicit non-goal). Distinct from Anthropic''s remote /ultrareview command.'

# Code ultrareview

<!-- canonical:adversarial-verification:start -->
## Critical — Adversarial verification

These rules govern how this skill trusts its own output — apply them whenever it verifies a claim, a defect, a source, or a decision before acting on it.

- Refute by default. Treat each non-trivial finding as unproven until a fresh-context check fails to refute it — the context that produced a claim cannot reliably clear it.
- No silent drop. Every finding flips the conclusion, is refuted in writing, or is filed as a risk or open question. A finding that vanishes without a verdict is a defect.
- Don't re-litigate settled facts. Spend adversarial effort on load-bearing or contested claims; let established facts pass. Over-refutation manufactures false doubt — it does not add rigor.
- Stay selective and cost-aware. Scale verification to the stakes; reversible, low-impact work gets a light touch, not a full adversarial sweep.
- Concede only to a strong rebuttal. A weak counter folds into the finding or gets filed; it does not overturn it.
<!-- canonical:adversarial-verification:end -->

<!-- canonical:execution-discipline:start -->
## Important — Engineering discipline

These rules govern how this skill changes code — apply them whenever it writes, edits, or proposes a fix.

- Minimal scope. Only what's directly requested or clearly necessary — no extra files, no abstraction for one use, no configurability nobody asked for, no error handling for states that can't happen. Validate at system boundaries; trust internal code.
- General solution, not the test cases. Implement the real logic for all valid inputs; never hard-code to inputs or bolt on workaround scripts to make a test pass. Tests verify the solution; they don't define it. A test is wrong? Say so — don't bend correct code to a broken test.
- Investigate before claiming. Never speculate about code you haven't opened; read the referenced file before answering. Ground every claim in what you actually read, not a plausible guess.
<!-- canonical:execution-discipline:end -->

<!-- canonical:label-hygiene:start -->
## Critical — Label hygiene

Internal planning labels are author coordinates, not reader coordinates. Strip them from every shipped artifact this skill emits — code, comments, commit subjects/bodies, PR titles/descriptions, release notes, doc paragraphs, non-trivial comments.

- **Workstream and task labels** — `WS-N`, `Phase-A`, `Step-3`, issue or ticket numbers, plan phase names from the source spec, issue body, or planning artifact. Translate to the domain noun (`Runs the battery script (WS-2)` → `Runs the battery script`). <!-- noqa: internal-label -->
- **Process language** — "the rebuild", "the prior `<file>`", "carried verbatim from", "the cleanup pass", "the audit", "spec AC" standalone. Replace with the concrete fact (`carries the routing from the prior aggregation` → `routes via the merge keys in the synthesis module`). <!-- noqa: internal-label -->
- **Plan-internal references** — "as the brief says", "per the workstream", "from the forge artifact". Drop the reference; state the fact directly.

Carve-outs — literal `WS-N` is legitimate where the skill IS the format authority (forge templates, apex rule documentation). Reviewer-facing dev docs (e.g. `MIGRATION.md` under `tests/<skill>/`) may reference deleted artifacts by their author-time names.
<!-- canonical:label-hygiene:end -->

> **Eight-axis judgment code review.** Five-phase pipeline scope → tool battery → 8 parallel axis reviewers → Haiku validators → synthesis. Always runs at full strength — every axis, full battery, no sampling. Distinct from Anthropic's remote `/ultrareview` — same goal, in-session on the user's subscription.

<!-- canonical:writing-rules:start -->
## Important — Writing rules

These rules govern every prose artifact this skill emits — READMEs, CHANGELOGs, commit messages, PR bodies, release notes, doc paragraphs, non-trivial comments. Apply them at draft time, verify before output.

- Match the surrounding style — punctuation, capitalization, backtick conventions, em-dash vs parens, bullet style.
- Every sentence changes the reader's understanding. Cut it otherwise.
- Front-load the verb — "Creates", not "This helps you create".
- Concrete over abstract. Lists for ≥3 enumerable items.
- Assert positively. Reserve negation for real constraints (`NEVER commit secrets`).
- No marketing words: powerful, robust, seamlessly, leverage, unlock, comprehensive, delightful.
- No AI tells: delve, tapestry, intricate, pivotal, testament, underscore, crucial, garner, showcase, additionally, moreover, furthermore, indeed.
- After drafting English prose, invoke `/humanize-en` if installed.

## Objective

Run the 8 axes — Correctness, Simplification, Tests, Documentation, Style, Intent, Design/API, Performance — as 8 parallel LLM subagents fed by deterministic tool findings from `scripts/run_battery.sh`. Coherence joins as a 9th axis when metadata files change. Sub-80 axis findings get re-scored by Haiku validators against the verbatim rubric in `references/anthropic-verbatim.md`. Findings synthesize into one report with deterministic dedup, inter-axis precedence, A2 no-silent-drop, and a verdict (Ship / Fix-then-ship / Needs work). The report ends with "What I did NOT check" so the coverage limits are explicit.

## Parameters

| Flag | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `-s` | Save the report + JSONL to `~/.agents/output/{project}/code-ultrareview/code-ultrareview-{slug}.{md,jsonl}` |
| `-S` | Force no-save (overrides any ambient save mode) |
| `-b <ref>` | Override the review base (skip auto-detection via `scripts/resolve_base.sh`) |
| `--repo-kind <kind>` | Override the scope classifier. Values: `skills`, `app`, `library`, `docs`, `monorepo`, `python`, `rust`, `go`, `unknown`. Persistent per-repo override at `.code-ultrareview.yaml` (`repo_kind: <kind>`); the flag wins on conflict. Invalid value exits 2 |
| `--reconcile <input>` | Activate the Intent-axis derivation sub-mode. `<input>` may be `@auto`, `@pr`, an explicit path or directory, `gh:pr:<N>`, `gh:issue:<owner>/<repo>#<N>`, or a GitHub issue URL. Findings classify as GAP / SCOPE-ADD / DECISION-OVERRIDE / CONSISTENT |
| `--verify-build` | Run build verification on sub-80 axis findings BEFORE Haiku validators (Phase 3.5). Builds + runs the test command detected by `scripts/build_detect.py`; confirmed findings get promoted (+30 confidence) and skip the validator phase |
| `--mutation-test` | Run Stryker (JS/TS), Pitest (JVM), or mutmut (Python) on changed files only. Surviving mutants route to the Tests axis as 🟠 Medium |
| `--apply-safe` | Opt-in writers: auto-apply low-risk fixes (manifest version sync, structured-field description sync with full-agreement guard, one failing test per confirmed bug). Diff preview + per-file confirmation before any write |
| `--include-prose` | Coherence axis compares README freeform paragraphs as well (default: structured fields only) |
| `--axes <list>` | Comma-separated subset of axes to run (e.g. `correctness,tests`). Default: all 8 + Coherence when triggered |
| `--preflight` | Runs `scripts/preflight_tools.sh --scope <scope.json>` — lists detected tools per repo_kind + prints install commands for missing ones. Informational only, no install |

Lowercase enables, uppercase disables. No `-f` — this skill is a producer, not a consumer.

```bash
/code-ultrareview                              # full 8-axis review, print report
/code-ultrareview -s                           # save the report + JSONL for /apex -f
/code-ultrareview -b origin/main               # review HEAD against an explicit base
/code-ultrareview --verify-build               # promote sub-80 findings via real build verification
/code-ultrareview --reconcile @auto            # add Intent derivation sub-mode with auto-detect
/code-ultrareview --apply-safe                 # full review + gated low-risk fixes
/code-ultrareview --preflight                  # list tools the battery would run, no review
/code-ultrareview --axes correctness,tests     # subset of axes
```

## The five phases

### Phase 1 — Scope

Runs `scripts/scope.py`. Deterministic, no LLM. Outputs `scope.json`:

- **Diff resolution** — clean tree → `scripts/resolve_base.sh` ladder; dirty tree → `git diff HEAD` + every untracked file inlined as added lines. Recipe for producing the `diff.patch` fed to Phase 3's `prepare --diff` (two-dot against the resolved base; untracked files via `git diff --no-index /dev/null <file>`): `references/orchestration.md` § *Produce the diff*.
- **Repo-kind classification** — 8 kinds (`skills` / `app` / `library` / `docs` / `monorepo` / `python` / `rust` / `go`) + `unknown`. Override via `--repo-kind` or `.code-ultrareview.yaml`.
- **CLAUDE.md chain** — root `CLAUDE.md` + nested `CLAUDE.md` in changed directories + `.claude/rules/*.md` + `~/.claude/rules/*.md`. Ordered root-to-deepest. Read by axis reviewers and validators.
- **Coherence activation** — any of `package.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `marketplace.json`, `SKILL.md`, root `README.md`, `tsconfig.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod` in the diff → `scope.json["activates_coherence"] = true`.
- **Languages detection** — from changed-file extensions; drives Phase 2 dispatch.

The output also feeds the report header lines `Repo: <kind>`, `Base: <ref>`, `Files: <N>`.

### Phase 2 — Tool battery

Runs `scripts/run_battery.sh`. Deterministic CLIs feed `tool-findings.jsonl` tagged by axis with `confidence: 100`. Tools dispatch per `scope.json["languages"]`: npx-wrapped (`knip` / `jscpd` / `markdownlint-cli2` / `@microsoft/api-extractor`) and uvx-wrapped (`lizard` / `vulture` / `semgrep` / `vale`) tools wrap zero-install; native binaries (`oasdiff` / `atlas` / Go `deadcode` `gocyclo` `dupl` / `cargo-machete`) fall back to PATH. Bundled `references/perf-rules/` carries the universal N+1 and sync-I/O semgrep rules. Per-tool axis routing lives in `scripts/battery_ingest.py`. Full Tool → Axis → Install table in `README.md`.

**Graceful skip.** Missing tools emit `WARN: <tool> not found — install: <command>` to stderr and append to `scope.json["tools_skipped"]`; the skill continues. The battery NEVER auto-installs — no `brew`, `cargo`, `go`, `pip`, or `npm` install runs.

**Phase 2 extension — `--mutation-test`.** `scripts/run_mutation.sh` dispatches Stryker (JS/TS), mutmut (Python), or pitest-maven (JVM) scoped to changed files only. Surviving mutants route to the Tests axis as 🟠 Medium with `confidence: 100` (skips Phase 4 validators). Runtime can exceed 10 minutes per language; default 600 s timeout overridable via `MUTATION_TIMEOUT`. Graceful skip on missing tool or config. Details: `references/ultra-execution.md`.

### Phase 3 — Axis review

The orchestrator prepares 8 per-axis bundles (+ Coherence when active) via `scripts/axis_dispatch.py prepare`, then launches every bundle as a parallel `Explore` `Task` (or your harness's equivalent) in one message. Each subagent reads its axis brief, the rubric in `references/anthropic-verbatim.md`, the diff, and its filtered tool findings. Each emits canonical-schema JSONL on stdout. Subagents cannot spawn other subagents — the main thread launches both axis reviewers AND validators. No subagent primitive in the harness? Run the axes sequentially and adversarially self-refute each finding in a fresh pass against the verbatim rubric before reporting — same phases, same contracts, no fan-out.

The 8 always-on axes: **Correctness** · **Simplification** · **Tests** · **Documentation** · **Style** · **Intent** · **Design/API** · **Performance**. Each maps to `references/axes/<name>.md` for scope + repo-kind branches. Coherence is the conditional 9th — added when `scope.json["activates_coherence"]` is true; when inactive, the header surfaces `Coherence axis: inactive` so the absence is visible. Full axis map, inter-axis precedence, and orchestration details (prepare CLI, bundle schema, no-silent-failure contract): `references/axes-overview.md` + `references/orchestration.md`.

### Phase 4 — Validation

The orchestrator prepares per-finding validator bundles via `scripts/run_validators.py prepare`, then launches one Haiku `Task` per finding in the same message — batched ≤10 parallel. Each validator receives the finding + diff context + the deepest matching CLAUDE.md snippet + the verbatim rubric, re-scores 0-100, and re-checks the cited CLAUDE.md rule actually exists in `claude_md_chain` (demotes with `CLAUDE.md rule not found at <path>` if not).

Confidence threshold = 80 (`scripts/synthesis_core.py:CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`). Tool-battery findings (confidence 100) skip the validator phase — they are deterministic. Validators stay read-only — no Write / Edit / Bash, no nested subagent spawn.

**Typical runtime.** 5-15 sub-80 findings → one batch → ~30-60s. 25+ findings spread over 2-3 batches stay under ~2 min. Latency is dominated by Haiku launch overhead, not inference.

**A2 contract.** No sub-80 finding silently dropped. Each one is promoted to ≥80, demoted with reason, or surfaced in `### ⚠️ Unverified` with the validator's reason text.

Validator prepare CLI, bundle schema, ingest pass details: `references/orchestration.md`.

**Phase 3.5 — `--verify-build`.** Build verification runs BEFORE validators via `scripts/run_build_verify.py` (composing `scripts/build_detect.py` + `synthesis_core.iterate_unverified` — +30 confidence, cap 95, floor 80). Sub-80 findings on `correctness` / `tests` / `design-api` / `performance` get promoted past the validator phase when the build fails. Other axes pass through unchanged. Details: `references/orchestration.md`.

### Phase 5 — Synthesis

Runs `scripts/synthesize.py` on top of `scripts/synthesis_core.py` primitives:

1. **Dedup** by `(location, finding-text)`.
2. **Inter-axis precedence** — when 2+ axes flag the same `file:line` with the same finding wording, highest severity wins; ties resolve via `Correctness > Design/API > Simplification > Tests > Documentation > Style > Intent > Performance > Coherence` (`scripts/synthesis_core.py:AXIS_PRIORITY`). Distinct findings at coincident lines (a Correctness null-deref and a Tests missing-assert on the same line) survive as separate entries.
3. **A2 routing** — sub-80 stays in Unverified with the validator's reason.
4. **Verdict** — `Ship` / `Fix-then-ship` / `Needs work` (`scripts/synthesis_core.py:compute_verdict`).
5. **Report emission** — markdown to terminal + `~/.agents/output/{project}/code-ultrareview/code-ultrareview-{slug}.md`. JSONL alongside with Conventional Comments labels (`issue` / `suggestion` / `nitpick` / `question`).

The closing **"What I did NOT check"** section is mandatory and always present, even when nothing was skipped — it lists security (defers to `/security-review`), runtime performance / benchmarks (explicit non-goal), flaky test detection (explicit non-goal), and any tools from `scope.json["tools_skipped"]`.

## Final report layout

`templates/code-ultrareview.md` is the canonical wire format — every `##` section renders verbatim in template order with its emoji prefix; no rename, merge, reorder, or improvise. **Terminal echo is mandatory** — the full canonical report prints to the chat-terminal on every invocation; `-s` is purely additive (writes the same bytes to `~/.agents/output/{project}/code-ultrareview/code-ultrareview-{slug}.md`, byte-for-byte identical to terminal output). Severity marker mapping (🔴 High blocks ship · 🟠 Medium fix-soon · 🟢 Low nit · ⚠️ Unverified sub-80) lives in `scripts/synthesize.py:SEVERITY_MARKERS`.

## Trust model

The skill ingests third-party content — CLAUDE.md files, PR bodies, planning artifacts (`--reconcile`), GitHub issue bodies — which can carry indirect prompt-injection. Axis reviewers and validators are read-only (no Write / Edit / Bash mutation). User review of the report is the trust boundary before any `--apply-safe` write; `--apply-safe` itself gates writes behind diff preview + per-file confirmation.

## Rules

- **Only new findings.** Issues the diff introduces. Pre-existing findings carry the `Pre-existing` tier for context, never flip the verdict.
- **No silent drop (A2).** Sub-80 findings surface in `### ⚠️ Unverified` with rationale `Sub-80 confidence ({score}) — verify locally before action.`
- **Fail loud.** A phase that cannot run (unresolvable base, missing tool with no skip path, dependency failure) appears in the header or as a finding. Never silent.
- **Cite precisely.** Every finding carries `file:line`; CLAUDE.md findings quote the violated rule verbatim; permalinks use `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/<full-sha>/<path>#L<n>-L<m>` (full SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD`).
- **Full report in chat every time.** The complete report prints to the terminal on every invocation. `-s` writes the same bytes to disk; it never gates or summarises chat output.
- **NEVER auto-install tools.** Missing tools surface install commands in the report and `scope.json["tools_skipped"]`. The user installs them.
- **NEVER modify code without `--apply-safe`.** Default is read-only review. `--apply-safe` writers are surgical and per-file confirmed.

## Deferrals

The closing "What I did NOT check" section always names these — explicit user-facing calibration of coverage:

- **Security** → `/security-review` or Anthropic's `claude-code-security-review`. Security is a distinct concern with its own deeper review pattern.
- **Runtime performance / benchmarks** → not covered. The Performance axis catches static patterns (N+1, sync I/O) but not runtime profiling.
- **Flaky test detection** → not covered. The Tests axis catches structural smells, not flake.
- **Tools from `scope.json["tools_skipped"]`** → listed explicitly so the user sees what they sacrificed by not installing the native binaries.

## Graceful degradation

- **No CLAUDE.md / no `.claude/rules`** — Style axis runs without baseline; the report says `Style axis: skipped — no rules baseline found`.
- **No `npx` / no `uvx`** — every wrappable tool skips; only PATH binaries run.
- **Missing native binary** (`oasdiff`, `atlas`, `cargo-machete`, Go tools) — emits to stderr + `scope.json["tools_skipped"]`. The relevant axis loses its tool input but still runs LLM judgment.
- **Unresolvable base** — fail loud with the resolver's hint line. Do not guess.
- **Unknown repo_kind** — axes run with their `unknown` branch (no specialization).
- **Coherence inactive** — when no metadata files change, the 9th axis simply does not launch. The report header says `Coherence axis: inactive` so the absence is visible.

## Composition

Bridge to the fix pass after the report ships:

- `/apex -f ~/.agents/output/{project}/code-ultrareview/code-ultrareview-{slug}.md` — structured fix pass (requires `-s`; pass the absolute path the report prints).
- `/oneshot "<finding>"` — single-finding quick fix (takes a description, not a file).

### Opt-in flag composition

The four opt-in flags layer orthogonally on the always-on pipeline: mutation tests join Phase 2 tool findings; `--verify-build` adds Phase 3.5; `--reconcile` enriches the Intent axis in Phase 3; `--apply-safe` writers run post-synthesis with diff preview + per-file confirmation. Without a flag, its feature is off. Full composition matrix and per-flag details: `references/ultra-execution.md`.

## What this skill is NOT

- **Not a security audit.** Defers to `/security-review`. The closing section makes this explicit on every report.
- **Not a linter or formatter.** The deterministic tool battery (npx/uvx-wrapped CLIs) handles linting and dead-code detection. The skill layers LLM judgment on top of those signals.
- **Not Anthropic's remote `/ultrareview`.** Distinct surface — this skill runs in-session on the user's subscription; `/ultrareview` runs in a remote sandbox and bills per run.
- **Not a fix tool.** Report-only by default. `--apply-safe` covers three surgical writers; everything else routes to `/apex` or `/oneshot`.

## References

- **Reviewer primitives** — `references/anthropic-verbatim.md` (rubric + HIGH SIGNAL + false-positive taxonomy), `references/axes-overview.md` (8 axes + Coherence + inter-axis precedence), `references/axes/<name>.md` (per-axis briefs), `references/orchestration.md` (Phase 3 + 4 + 3.5 prepare CLIs and bundle schemas).
- **Opt-in flags** — `references/ultra-execution.md` covers `--verify-build`, `--mutation-test`, `--reconcile`, `--apply-safe` in full.
- **Scripts** — `scope.py` (Phase 1), `run_battery.sh` + `battery_ingest.py` (Phase 2), `axis_dispatch.py` (Phase 3), `run_validators.py` (Phase 4), `synthesize.py` + `synthesis_core.py` + `findings_to_jsonl.py` (Phase 5). Opt-in: `run_build_verify.py`, `run_mutation.sh`, `derivation/run.py`, `preflight_tools.sh` (`--preflight`), `apply_safe/{version_sync,description_sync,failing_test_writer}.py`.

## Gotchas

1. **Sub-80 findings can be dropped instead of surfaced in `### ⚠️ Unverified`.** The A2 contract (`scripts/synthesis_core.py:apply_a2`) is no-silent-drop. The model sometimes treats a sub-80 score as a rejection signal and omits the finding entirely. Fix: scan the `### ⚠️ Unverified` section explicitly on every report; compare finding count to axis output to catch drops.
2. **First-run `npx` / `uvx` downloads add latency.** Cold start adds ~5s per tool the first time the battery touches it; subsequent runs are fast (cached at `~/.npm/_npx` / `~/.cache/uv`). The README install table documents this so users don't fear repeated downloads.
3. **Coherence activates silently on metadata changes.** A single `package.json` touch triggers the 9th subagent automatically. Watch for the `Coherence axis: active` line in the report header — it tells you the axis ran without you asking.
4. **`--reconcile @auto` skips silently on malformed planning artifacts.** A forge or apex file with broken YAML frontmatter (unclosed `---`, tab indentation, unquoted colons) is dropped from the auto-detect list. Verify with `head -20 ~/.agents/output/{project}/forge/forge-*.md` before relying on `@auto`.
