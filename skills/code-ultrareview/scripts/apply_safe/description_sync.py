"""Description-sync writer for --apply-safe.

Aligns structured description fields under a strict **full-agreement
guard**: write the new value only when every present source already
agrees on the new value. Partial agreement → refuses with
`refusing: partial-agreement` and exits 1.

The guard is the Risk #3 mitigation — auto-fixing descriptions when
sources disagree could overwrite a deliberate divergence. Use
`.coherence-ignore` to whitelist legitimate divergences instead.
