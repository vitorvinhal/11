# fetch_commits.sh — emit NUL-delimited commit records between base and HEAD.
#
# Reads the base from `resolve_base.sh` (same precedence ladder the rest of
# the skill uses) unless `-b <ref>` overrides it. Emits one record per
# commit on stdout:
#
#   <sha>\0<subject>\0<body>\0---\n
#
# NUL separators keep commit messages with embedded newlines or shell
# metacharacters intact; the trailing `---\n` lets line-oriented parsers
# find record boundaries without re-counting NULs. Consumed by the
# Documentation axis subagent (Phase 3) as input for the prose-hygiene
# sub-judgment over commit subjects and bodies.
#
# Output also includes a header line so consumers know what they're reading:
#
#   RESULT: base=<ref> commit_count=<N>
#
# Exit:
#   0   resolved and emitted (commit_count may be 0)
#   2   base could not be resolved — passes through from resolve_base.sh
