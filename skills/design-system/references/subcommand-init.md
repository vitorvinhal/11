# `init` subcommand

Scaffold a minimal valid DESIGN.md from scratch. Fallback path for projects where `/award-design` isn't installed or the user wants a bare-bones starter.

## Invocation

```bash
/design-system init                              # generic minimal template at ./DESIGN.md
/design-system init minimalist                   # Minimalist archetype starter
/design-system init bento-card -o docs/DESIGN.md # custom path
```

## Flags

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `<archetype>` positional | Optional hint — if given, recommend `/award-design` for archetype-aware creation instead of a generic scaffold (see *On archetype flavors* below) |
| `-o <path>` | Output path (default: `./DESIGN.md`) |

## Priority — use `/award-design` when available

If `/award-design` is installed, the best init path is:

```bash
/award-design <brief>                 # full archetype recommendation + atmosphere + DESIGN.md
```

`init` is explicitly the lighter fallback — no brief discussion, no archetype debate, just a starter file the user can fill in. If the user invokes `init` when `award-design` is installed, suggest the richer path once, then proceed with `init` if the user confirms.

## Workflow

`$SKILL_DIR` = this skill's folder — `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` in Claude Code, the directory containing the skill's SKILL.md elsewhere.

1. **Check if target path exists**. If a `DESIGN.md` is already at the target:
   - Abort by default — don't silently overwrite.
   - Offer three options: overwrite (with backup), run `/design-system audit` on the existing file instead, or run `/design-system migrate` if the existing file looks like Stitch format.
2. **Check `/award-design` availability**. If present and user hasn't opted into `init`, surface the suggestion.
3. **Select template**:
   - No archetype → generic minimal template (primary neutral palette, Inter typography, 4px radius scale, 8px spacing base, button + card + input components)
   - Archetype given → recommend `/award-design` (see *On archetype flavors* below) and only proceed with the generic template if the user confirms
4. **Write** the file to `-o <path>` or `./DESIGN.md`.
5. **Run audit** on the new file: `bash "$SKILL_DIR"/scripts/audit.sh <output>`. A minimal template should lint with ≤ 2 warnings (`orphaned-tokens`, `missing-sections` is acceptable for placeholders).
6. **Report** to the user:
   - Path created
   - Audit status
   - Next step: "Fill in the TODOs, then run `/design-system audit` again to track progress"

## Generic minimal template

```yaml
---
version: alpha
name: <TODO: project name>
description: <TODO: one sentence about the visual identity>
colors:
  primary: "#000000"
  neutral: "#FFFFFF"
  surface: "#FFFFFF"
  on-surface: "#000000"
typography:
  headline-lg:
    fontFamily: Inter
    fontSize: 48px
    fontWeight: 600
    lineHeight: 1.1
  body-md:
    fontFamily: Inter
    fontSize: 16px
    fontWeight: 400
    lineHeight: 1.6
  label-sm:
    fontFamily: Inter
    fontSize: 13px
    fontWeight: 500

## Overview

<TODO: describe the brand personality, target audience, and emotional response the UI should evoke.>

## Colors

<TODO: describe each color role — when to use primary, when to use surface, etc.>

## Typography

<TODO: describe the type strategy — serif vs sans, weight philosophy, hierarchy logic.>

## Layout

<TODO: describe the grid strategy, spacing scale rationale, and responsive breakpoints.>

## Elevation & Depth

<TODO: describe how visual hierarchy is conveyed — shadows, tonal layers, borders.>

## Shapes

<TODO: describe the corner radius language and shape philosophy.>

## Components

<TODO: describe each component's styling guidance. Start with button-primary; add more as the project grows.>

## Do's and Don'ts

- Do <TODO: one specific rule>
- Don't <TODO: one specific rule>
```

The template is intentionally sparse — enough to lint green with info-level findings, but no more. It exists to give the user a valid shape to fill in, not to prescribe design.

## On archetype flavors

`init` ships only the generic template above. Archetype-flavored starters — Minimalist, Brutalist, Editorial, Bold / Maximal, Immersive / Cinematic, Experimental, Corporate Luxury, Bento / Card, Spatial Organic — are `/award-design`'s job. The accepted kebab-case slugs are `minimalist`, `brutalist`, `editorial`, `bold-maximal`, `immersive-cinematic`, `experimental`, `corporate-luxury`, `bento-card`, `spatial-organic`. That skill already has per-archetype reference files, atmosphere calibration, and brief-aware prose; duplicating its templating here would drift over time.

If a user runs `/design-system init <archetype>`, treat the archetype argument as a hint and recommend the richer path:

> `/award-design` would produce a complete, archetype-flavored DESIGN.md for a `<archetype>` design — with a full palette tuned to the archetype, typography pairing, component specs, and atmosphere scores. Proceed with `/design-system init` (generic template) only if you want a bare-bones scaffold to hand-edit.

If the user confirms the generic path, proceed with the template above (no archetype flavor). If they redirect to `/award-design`, delegate there.

## Post-init guidance

After creating the file, tell the user:

1. **Fill in the TODOs** — the prose sections, especially Overview and Do's and Don'ts, need domain-specific content.
2. **Refine the palette** — the default colors are placeholders; update them to match the brand.
3. **Run `/design-system audit`** after each editing session to catch drift early.
4. **Consider `/award-design`** if stuck — it can recommend an archetype and fill in the creative direction.

## Edge cases

- **Target path exists**: always abort by default. Offer overwrite (with `.legacy.<timestamp>` backup), `audit`, or `migrate` depending on what's already there.
- **Archetype given but `/award-design` not installed**: proceed with the generic template and note that archetype flavor would have required `/award-design`.
- **Directory doesn't exist** (e.g., `-o docs/DESIGN.md` with no `docs/`): surface the error, suggest `mkdir -p` or a different path.
